# Assignment - Treller
## Problem Statement
Create a project management application (like Trello).

A project management application (like Trello) is where you can manage your project by tracking smaller tasks.

### Actual Trello

### Assignment Trello
![Treelo - Assignment](https://github.com/workattech/mock-machine-coding-3/blob/master/docs/trello.png?raw=true)

- The app contains multiple boards to signify different projects
- Each board contains different lists to signify sub-project
- Each list contain different cards signifying smaller tasks
- Each card can be assigned to a user or may remain unassigned

## Requirements
- User: Each user should have a userId, name, email.
- Board: Each board should have a id, name, privacy (PUBLIC/PRIVATE), url, members, lists
- List: Each list should have a id, name and cards
- Card: Each card should have a id, name, description, assigned user
- We should be able to create/delete boards, add/remove people from the members list and modify attributes. Deleting a board should delete all lists inside it.
- We should be able to create/delete lists and modify attributes. Deleting a list should delete all cards inside it.
- We should be able to create/delete cards, assign/unassign a member to the card and modify attributes
- We should also be able to move cards across lists in the same board
- Ability to show all boards, a single board, a single list and a single card
- Default privacy should be public
- Cards should be unassigned by default
- Ids should be auto-generated for board/list/card
- URLs should get created based on the id

## Input

- You can create a few users in your main method. No need to take it as input.
- There will be different types of input:
    - BOARD CREATE <board_name>
    - BOARD <board_id> <name/privacy> <new_value> 
    - BOARD <board_id> <ADD_MEMBER/REMOVE_MEMBER> <user_id>
    - BOARD DELETE <board_id>
    - LIST CREATE <board_id> <list_name>
    - LIST <list_id> <name> <new_value>
    - LIST DELETE <list_id>
    - CARD CREATE <list_id> <card_name>
    - CARD <card_id> <name/description> <new_value> 
    - CARD <card_id> ASSIGN <user_id>
    - CARD <card_id> UNASSIGN
    - CARD <card_id> MOVE <target_list_id> 
    - CARD DELETE <card_id>
    - SHOW
    - SHOW BOARD <board_id>
    - SHOW LIST <list_id>
    - SHOW CARD <card_id>
- If you want you create these in the main method without taking user input.

## Output

- CREATE operations should print the id after creation
- SHOW should print all the boards with all the lists inside them and all the cards inside all the lists (including all the attributes)
- SHOW <BOARD/LIST> should print that specific entity and everything inside it (including all the attributes)
- SHOW CARD should print all the attributes of the card
- You can use any format to print these. Printing in json is not compulsory.

## Expectations
- Take all input from STDIN
- Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code
- Make sure that the code is functionally correct
- Code should be modular and readable
- Separation of concern should be addressed
- Please do not write everything in a single file
- Code should easily accommodate new requirements and minimal changes
- There should be a main method from where the code could be easily testable
- [Optional] Write unit tests, if possible
- No need to create a GUI

## Optional Requirements
**Please do these only if youâ€™ve time left**. You can write your code such that these could be accommodated without changing your code much.
- Ability to clone a list with all the cards in it. All of these should have a different id.
- Ability to delete all the cards in a list without deleting the list
- Option to add tags to a card and ability to get cards based on assigned tags 
- Ability to find all the cards assigned to a particular user

## C++ Requirements
- ```JSON``` serialization is also required. However, first Get the required output working

## Hint for C++ People
1. For ``` JSON ``` serialization, use the concept of Operator overloading wherein you would want to overload the ``` vector/list/map/unordered_map ``` container classes by inheriting these classes
container. It is slightly challenging. 
However, it is a very good learning as to how these classes are implemented.
**OR**
2. You can also overload your class as well for easy/pretty printing.
**OR**
3. You can publicly inherit these classes. But add a feature of pretty print function such as ```JSONPrint()```. Example for vector.
``` cpp
template <typename T>
string vector::JSONPrint(vector<T> v)
{
    // JSON Serialize code goes here
}
```
**OR**
4. You can create helper function for the sake of this App.

IMHO, given these choices, my personal preference would be (3). However, I leave upto you.
